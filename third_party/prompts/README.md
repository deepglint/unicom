# OpenEQA Prompts

This folder contains the prompts used for baseline methods and automatic evaluations with LLM-Match.

The LLM-Match prompts are in [mmbench.txt](mmbench.txt) and [mmbench-extra.txt](mmbench-extra.txt) and were adapted from [MMBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06281). The `mmbench.txt` prompt is used when a single ground truth answer is available and `mmbench-extra.txt` is used when more than one ground truth answer is available.
