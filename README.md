This repository is dedicated to building foundational visual models using large-scale datasets such as LAION400M and COYO700M. We employ sample-to-cluster contrastive learning to optimize performance. Our models have been thoroughly validated across various tasks, including multimodal visual large language models (e.g., LLaVA), image retrieval, and image classification.

While CLIP models have shown excellence in many tasks via image-text contrastive learning, they often struggle with encoding complex semantic structures within images. To address this limitation, we introduce **Multi-Label Cluster Discrimination (MLCD)**.



MLCD improves upon traditional approaches by clustering the the LAION dataset, which contains billions of images, into one million centers and assigning multiple closest clusters as labels to each image. This technique accounts for the presence of multiple objects within a single image. We also introduce a novel multi-label classification loss, which separately handles positive and negative class losses, minimizing label ambiguity. Our experiments demonstrate that MLCD achieves state-of-the-art performance in linear probe. Moreover, MLCD shows significant potential when integrated with multimodal large language models. The following two figures compare the evaluation performance of our model on MLLM and Linear Probe. The model we used is ViT-L-14@336px.

###  MLLMs Evaluation Results

To evaluate MLCD’s performance within multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we replaced the CLIP model in LLaVA-NeXT with the MLCD model. We paired this with the Qwen2.5-7B language model. For reproducibility, we utilized the LLaVA-Pretrain dataset for pre-training and the LLaVA-NeXT-Data for structured fine-tuning. The evaluation results confirm that the MLCD model performs exceptionally well across multiple benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in MLLMs.

[![Arxiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2304.05884-red)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05884) [![Google Drive](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Drive-Model-yellow)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18wsNgZeNpjKAcIrWoffJ8o9UqmMHUBqN?usp=share_link)


For image representation:
1. ImageNet pretraining is not universal enough to generalize to diverse open-world objects.
2. Supervised learning is not scalable because manual annotation of large-scale training data is time-consuming, costly, and even infeasible.
3. Instance discrimination method (e.g., CLIP) can hardly encode the semantic structure of training data, because instance-wise contrastive learning always treats two samples as a negative pair, regardless of their semantic similarity.

UNICOM demonstrates superior performance in image retrieval, thanks to its ability to cluster **400000000** images into **1000000** pseudo classes using joint textual and visual features extracted by the CLIP model. Additionally, our use of a margin-based softmax loss (ArcFace) and random partial class/feature (PartialFC) selections enhances the robustness and compactness of the feature embedding. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised image retrieval approaches, making it a powerful tool for researchers and practitioners in the field.
